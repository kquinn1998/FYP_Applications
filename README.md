# Revolute_Fitness
This is my gym app for my final year project. Kevin Quinn C00216607.

Here are all files and documented to do with my project from the ionic applications source code,
to the flask app and python script to make my machine learning model and also my project site.

--INSTALL--
To install the app take the apk file called "apk-release.apk" and place it on the internal storage of an android device,
on the device locate the file click on it and select install, you will be prompted not to install it but click install anyways as it is
not coming from the Google Play Store, once installed load up the app create the account verify the email and work away !
